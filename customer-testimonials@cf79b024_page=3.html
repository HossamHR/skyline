<p><a href="about-us/people-and-culture/dan-williams-wellington-renovation-builder/index.html">Dan</a> and his team helped us replace our bathroom after some extensive water damage. They did a fantastic job! They are professional, reliable and efficient. Matt was always just a phone call or an email away, and he went above and beyond to give us a high-quality, beautiful bathroom. The tradespeople they work with all take great pride in completing their work to a very high standard and were all really professional on site. If I ever have to do renovations again, Dan and his team will be the only people I call!</p>

We recently had our sun room converted into outdoor balcony with beautiful wood decking and customised screen doors installed. They consulted with body corporate on my behalf and saved me so much time and stress. Everything was done beautifully and planned to a schedule we will absolutely have them again for any future renovations and would recommend to everyone. I am very pleased with the results and believe the pricing was very fair for the very high quality of work and professional service. Thank you.<br>

<p><a href="about-us/people-and-culture/chiraag-rambhai-central-auckland-renovation-builder/index.html">Corey</a> and his team were fantastic to deal with from start to finish. The renovation service was professional, and was well laid out and managed through online software. Renovating in an apartment comes with it's barriers and obstacles, which we were all collectively able to overcome. Was kept informed with the project throughout. We renovated a floor, laundry room, wardrobe and sun seat. Would recommend anyone to use Corey and his team for any mid to large renovation projects.</p>

<p>I hired refresh to construct a one story extension and create a kitchen dinner and downstairs toilet. I wanted someone to project manage it all for and was really taken on the idea of a fixed maximum price. <a href="about-us/people-and-culture/sort/united-kingdom/all/index.html">Sergio</a> took me through the whole process from all the planning through to completion.

<p>I purchased a home and planned to remove some built-in joinery and give a fresh coat of paint, but unexpectedly behind the joinery in each room were concrete exterior walls and water damage- and I discovered this when I already had a team of painters there. I was quite stressed, as I did not have a builder involved in the project, but remembered I had Hashim's contact details from a previous tentative discussion about potential reno's down the track- one phone call to Hashim and he was there with his building manager literally within an hour- we had new walls installed for the painters within 24 hours- it was so fast that painters were completely uninterrupted. Saved the day is an understatement, <a href="about-us/people-and-culture/hashim-nasser-sydney-renovation-builder/index.html">Hashim</a> and John worked so hard at a moments notice to not only fix our surprise wall problem but also to coordinate tradespeople and "finish the house" to an incredibly high standard. To get the job done on a tight timeline, John was there himself mixing concrete on a Saturday afternoon, we are beyond grateful for the help and high quality work. SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD do very high-quality work with excellent attention to detail and are very experienced builders/renovators.</p>

<p>SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD' service was excellent. From the first meeting with Guy Allenby we knew we were in the hands of an experienced professional who really wanted to create a beautiful home for us. He patiently introduced us to a variety of designers at the outset and was always available to discuss ideas and options. During the build, Guy worked through arising issues with us calmly and intelligently. He never failed to go the extra mile and we were so thankful for his generosity and support! We would highly recommend Guy and SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD to anyone embarking on the journey to renovate and create a new home. We are absolutely thrilled with the final result.<br>

<p>We wanted to modernise our thirty-year-old home and still retain the country charm. Where could we even begin? Thankfully we began with SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD. They listened, talked, designed and redesigned.&#160; ( thanks Morgen). They organised, managed and coordinated ( thanks to Martin ) They turned the nearly impossible into the very possible ( a big thanks to builder Paul ). They brought thoughts into reality ( thanks to all those expert tradesmen ).<br><br>
SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD bring good old fashioned know-how to the table coupled with the integrity, patience and understanding that paves the way for an excellent outcome. They stand one hundred percent behind their promises ( even for up to seven years after the build ). Now that is refreshing!<br><br>
This is a team that deserves to be, not only commended, but also, highly recommended.<br>

Most importantly we want to thank you for the advantage of the realistic pricing, prior and to the commencement of our renovations.

<p>We contracted SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD to renovate our existing kitchen and convert part of the integral garage into a utility room and downstairs washroom. The work started one week before the country went into Lockdown, and quickly the work fell into difficulties with having to reduce the workers on site due to the need to maintain social distancing and problems obtaining supplies. The issues meant that the agreed timescales were eventually doubled, but despite this, the work was eventually completed. There were various specification changes due to the supply problems, but the team were very pro-active in bringing these changes to light and flexible in their approach to resolving these and other issues as they arose. Many thanks to <a href="about-us/people-and-culture/sort/united-kingdom/all/index.html">Sergio</a>, Christian and their always cheerful team for their work in bringing this project to a successful conclusion, and we are very happy with the final result.</p>

<p>SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD&#160;did the best renovation on my flat - so creative, so well-priced, so precise and careful and with so much kindness and professionalism.

Very, very highly recommended. I would give more than 5 stars if I could.<br>

<p>I was delighted, after having had what I felt were a few quick quotes from others, when <a href="about-us/people-and-culture/martin-peirone-gold-coast-renovation-specialist/index.html">Martin</a> came and spent about an hour with me at the first visit &#8211; so important to me as someone with no other way of judging the likely quality of end results from different builders. I felt Rick, our builder, and Martin, made an excellent team, with Martin providing excellent communication, and calling on Rick&#8217;s extensive knowledge of the construction side, whenever I asked a question Martin was not sure about. The process of negotiating with the council to maximise the size of the deck I was allowed was also invaluable.<br>
The uncertainties of timelines for completion were I feel well explained, and set out in the contract, and although exceeded to some extent, I was comfortable with this having to some extent been forewarned about delays with council approvals.<br>
Likewise, with the budget, it was higher than I had anticipated but seemed reasonable for the attention being paid to the project.<br>
I would strongly recommend SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD to someone not quite sure of how to go about the whole process of translating their idea into reality, and as I think the photos show, along with favourable comments from neighbours, the excellent end result is witness to the value of the careful, unhurried thought and planning which Martin and Rick put into every step along the way.</p>

We are very happy with the plans and files that have been done. They were always very helpful in making any changes we required during the process.<br><br>
I am happy to recommend them in their service and professionalism.</p>

At all stages through&#160;the process, there was clear communication, a common-sense approach, regular meetings and with the customer portal that you get access to, we could always see the total costs, change requests, approvals and the timeline.

<p><a href="about-us/people-and-culture/lia-boersma-wellington-renovation-builder/index.html">Lia</a> is amazing. We had some renovation work done to our place 12 months ago. Throughout the process she was incredibly professional, and made sure our needs were met. During the lockdown recently, we noticed a leak in the ceiling (on a Friday night to make things worse). We emailed Lia, and within an hour we had roofers organised for the next day, and all covered under their warranty. We were incredibly impressed with this, and shows that the ongoing support will be there. It is one thing to have a good experience during the work, but to maintain this level after completion is on another level. If I could rate Lia and her team higher I would. I would absolutely recommend her to anyone.</p>

<p>We found the SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD team great to work with. When we decided to renovate (knocking out a wall to make kitchen/lounge open plan, new kitchen, two bathrooms)&#160; we had very little knowledge about the work that was required to achieve the outcome that we wanted.&#160; Working with the refresh team made the whole process very easy as they had the knowledge and contacts to make our reno fast and easy. We found that everything was clearly communicated and when we had questions or wanted more of an explanation our Renovation Consultant &#160;was always available. We were able to share our ideas with confidence that what we wanted would be respected as well as being provided with some solutions to problem areas that we had been unsure of what to do with.&#160;The building team in particular were excellent! We are thrilled with the end result of our renovation and would recommend that anyone who is thinking about using a renovation company give the SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD team a call.</p>

<p>The SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD team were amazing to deal with. We went on the journey of a re-roof, reclad and upgraded to double glazing. From the initial consult through to the end, the Team were communicative, offered solutions, supportive, approachable and efficient. It made what was deemed to be a daunting project into an absolute breeze. They embraced a new cladding product and absolutely owned it. We can not recommend them enough.

<p>We knew we wanted to stay in our home as long as possible but with only 3 bedrooms and one living space room was getting tight with toys galore after having our son in 2017.&#160;&#160; I reached out to the land of facebook and a friend reached out and advised her brother in law Leigh owned his own renovations business and to have a look.&#160;&#160; I jumped on to the facebook page and immediately saw a garage conversion and loved the results. I knew what I wanted and I knew I wanted quality work and I didn&#8217;t want to have to deal with organising tradies etc myself so it worked out well to go through someone who would do it all for us.&#160;&#160; We met with Leigh and he went through the process and straight away we felt comfortable with him.&#160;&#160; The process was smooth enough, and each step was met with lots of communication along the way. We always knew where we stood in the process and there was never any unknown with Leigh.&#160;&#160; Once we agreed to the price and the permit was approved it was all steam ahead from there.&#160;&#160; Any questions throughout the process Leigh was very quick to respond and any concerns he was right on top of it and onto it promptly.&#160;&#160; Whilst the cost of doing jobs like this doesn&#8217;t come cheap especially when you are using a renovation specialist, it does take the stress out of having to arrange tradies, quotes, etc and that for us meant more than saving some money.&#160;&#160; Overall we are very very happy with the renovation, it has allowed us to stay in our home which we built for many more years and provided us much more room and a lovely outdoor pergola for upcoming summer.&#160;&#160; Love our new space, Thank you so much Leigh, Richard, Rob, and all the boys!</p>

<p>As an inexperienced renovator with no trade skills, contacts or ideas heading into a renovation is a very daunting process. When I called <a href="about-us/people-and-culture/leigh-mcdonald-melbourne-renovation-specialist/index.html">Leigh</a> to come out and give me a run down on the process involved in a garage conversion I felt immediately assured that I&#8217;d made a smart decision in outsourcing this overwhelming task. To Leigh&#8217;s credit despite his belief that the project might not even get off the ground due to council regulations he did the professional thing and went through with the presentation anyway. Fortunately he was only half right and the project could continue. The entire process from start to finish was entirely stress free, the only hands on involvement I was required to have was choosing flooring, fittings and finishes (the only parts I felt reasonably comfortable in having input). All the trades were organised and managed, materials and deliveries coordinated, as well as a skip bin for demolition and a cleaner to finish it all off, all I had to do was give him an ok via text. All this right through the stage 2 and 3 lockdown restrictions. The finished product significantly exceeds our expectations and I could not recommend Leigh and the team at SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD East &amp; South East any higher!</p>

<p>I used SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD and <a href="about-us/people-and-culture/kelley-malcher-surrey-builders/index.html">Kelley</a> to completely redecorate the ground floor including large open plan living area, kitchen, office and utility room. The job involved re-tiling the whole area and painting some walls and wallpapering. As well as skirting boards and finishing: grouting/sealing etc. It truly is a fully managed service right down to prep work, removal of waste (including all the tiles), and even help/advice with choosing the right tiles and even colour scheme. The quality of the finish was outstanding; each worker&#160;was quick, clean and very professional. The pricing was very honest given the level of service, with no hidden costs. I would thoroughly recommend for anyone wanting a high-quality finish, and hassle-free experience.</p>

<p>We came across SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD through television advertisements and commercials specifically on the Living channel. It was important to us when we chose SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD to consider company, service, quality and price. We wanted a complete professional package, with a personal touch. This is where the likes of SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD Renovation specialists <a href="about-us/people-and-culture/lia-boersma-wellington-renovation-builder/index.html">Lia</a>, and Charmaine were able to work their magic.&#160;<br>
The team at SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD, especially Charmaine Davis, allowed for us to have a positive relationship with every aspect of such a large project. Charmaine was the main point of contact throughout the entire renovation. This was important, as she fully understood our vision, needs and drivers with us having full confidence in her to make it work.&#160;<br>
Charmaine invested a lot of time during the design process to ensure the design concept was thorough and reflected the vision. Options were presented, which was very helpful as it gave us different perspectives/alternatives and some good ideas on how to realise our vision. Charmaine guided us all the way along during the selection of products and fittings and we trusted her advice and this saved a lot of time. Final designs were completed once all the key decisions were agreed by us &#8211; which we loved!<br>
Our budget and priorities did not always match and hence there was quite a lot of discussion before we made our final decisions. Having options and alternatives presented to us was helpful in making the decisions. At times, trade off decisions were consciously made.<br>
There was so much happening at any point in time, having a project manager managing the workflow, subcontractors and issues was crucial. Lia was the project manager supported by a project coordinator. The team worked very well together although there were a couple of new players.<br>
We were well informed on a timely basis and were kept up to date where necessary. We had quite a few issues for various things and decisions had to be made quickly to keep the project moving especially towards the end. SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD did a lot of running around for us, managed the professions extremely well and we appreciated the final clean ups which were done personally.<br>
We would recommend SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD and the help of Charmaine Davis to ensure your renovation runs to plan with an exceedingly good home at the end. SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD are very professional and customer-focused. They have really brought our vision to life and delivered a quality outcome. Homeowners should be aware though that major projects do take time, and that there are often procedures and hiccups that occur, but at the end of the day SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD managed to ensure our home was as close to what we imagined as possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>I recently used <a href="about-us/people-and-culture/lia-boersma-wellington-renovation-builder/index.html">Lia Boersma</a>&#160;and her team at SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD for a new Kitchen renovation including extending my kitchen out by 3 metres.<br>
As a widower without much experience about renovation work (my wife did all our previous renovations!), I was very apprehensive about what was required. This is where SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD exceeded all my expectations, firstly from Charmaine Davis who assisted me with the design and purchasing the cabinetry, bench appliances etc and Katie from Mastercraft then, after Charmaine left, Lia took over and continued the process seamlessly.<br>
Special mention also to firstly Milo who managed the overall project. Milo stated on the first day that we met that he wanted to treat my build as if it was his own home and that he wanted this overall experience to be a pleasant one for me. He was absolutely true to his word and kept me informed all along the way. I would recommend him to anyone doing a renovation project. Many Thanks&#160;Milo.<br>
Can I also pay mention to the builders Ben &amp; Tyler who worked diligently and were incredibly friendly, we got along really well. This could be said also for the others involved in each part of the project, Stan the electrician, Tony the plumber, Andrew from Mastercraft, the lads who did the flooring (who stayed to well after 7 pm to get the job done) and of course Fraser, the painter. These were some of the guys I met and had a friendly relationship with. That does not denigrate from the others involved in the project, who did their job professionally, but at times when I wasn&#8217;t there so I didn&#8217;t always get to meet them.<br>
Finally Lia, many thanks for providing me with a great experience and I am absolutely thrilled with the final result. I spend most of my time now in the new kitchen which also has a living area component to it and I love every moment of it.<br>
Next time I do renovations I will be looking nowhere further than SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD and will recommend you to others absolutely.</p>

<p>We had renovated a previous house ourselves and knew this would be a large job. We were attracted by the idea of having the work professionally project managed to ensure that it was done on time and to budget. We initially met <a href="about-us/people-and-culture/lia-boersma-wellington-renovation-builder/index.html">Lia</a> at a home show and were impressed enough to request a site meeting to talk through what we wanted done. After discussing our ideas with them and suggesting solutions, Lia and her team began putting together a design. Lia was excellent at preparing the initial quote, finding ways to fit the work we wanted done into our budget, and then overseeing the ongoing work with (construction manager) Milo. We were particularly impressed with her estimates as they were pretty much spot on&#8230;(She) was unfailingly polite and patient in her dealings with us and managed our expectations well. She also provided good advice about interior design.</p>

<p>After having suffered a series of botched bathroom renovations over the span of many years, I decided to employ SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD.&#160;For 14 years we hadn&#8217;t enjoyed using our two bathrooms and we had a considerable leaking problem from both showers.<br>
From the moment SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD and <a href="about-us/people-and-culture/lia-boersma-wellington-renovation-builder/index.html">Lia Boersma</a> were engaged, Charmaine our project manager, took a quiet yet totally reliable control of the project. Together with thoroughly professional builders (Gareth and Boe), Plumbers (Graham and Connor), Tilers (Andreas and Peter) and glass installer (Phil), they left us with beautiful bathrooms with we can enjoy. The tilers were so good I got them to retile the kitchen as well.<br>
Thanks to everyone involved. You restored my faith in New Zealand&#8217;s building profession.</p>

<p>I definitely made the right choice leaving my renovation needs to <a href="about-us/people-and-culture/hashim-nasser-sydney-renovation-builder/index.html">Hashim</a> from SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD. Hashim's professionalism and experience came to fore right from the start, where we generated design ideas through to the quoting and delivery process. I'm particularly thankful for his constant research and management of tradies, architects, consultants and private certifiers. Breaking down my external wall and building an outdoor deck didn't come without obstacles, especially from our local council and certifiers. But Hashim pushed through and fought for our family, which now not only opened up our house but gave us a home to be proud of! I look forward to our next project.</p>

<p>We met&#160;<a href="about-us/people-and-culture/kelley-malcher-surrey-builders/index.html">Kelley</a>&#160;and&#160;<a href="about-us/people-and-culture/sort/united-kingdom/all/index.html">Kim</a>&#160;back in Oct 2019. We just had one single week in London to address all renovation works we intended to do: decide on how the new kitchen would look like and several other works to be performed as the house was rented out for some years. The main works were in the kitchen and lounge: a new kitchen fitted far more functional than the original one with loads of additional space, some new appliances and a full new floor all over the lower floor of the house. Kelley perfectly understood what we wanted, presented us the different options, helped us with the kitchen vendors to take all decisions, issued the proposal and we closed the deal during that week. Extremely effective, extremely professional. The next step was the execution. It all went so smoothly. We were aware of every step via an app where we followed all works daily and we also created a&#160;WhatsApp group to exchange&#160;information. On the date agreed to have all finished... it was all finished! Zero hassle, zero problems and looks beautiful! We truly recommend SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD, and shall it be the case we need services, we have no doubt of contacting Kelley and Kim again. Many thanks to the SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD team!&#160;<br>

<p>Throughout the whole project I felt listened to, supported to and communication was second to none. As this was the first renovation I had ever done I needed a bit of guidance and this was given freely. Lots of options given especially when additional work needed to be done. Very professional team. Thanks <a href="about-us/people-and-culture/sort/new-zealand/wellington/index.html">Mark</a> and the team for the job well done!</p>

<p>We recently engaged <a href="about-us/people-and-culture/dave-georgetti-auckland-renovation-builder/index.html">Dave Georgetti</a> and his team from SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD Remuera to undertake a total house renovation. Thoroughly professional, yet personable. We are very pleased with the result -&#160;enjoying our new home in time for the summer break. The essential value-add that Dave/SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD provide is to guide you through the myriad of tradespeople, suppliers and decision making. All whilst keeping up the relentless momentum against a detailed project plan and budget. We challenged Dave many times with decision changes mid-project and he handled it with flexible good cheer all the way through to completion. Do not underestimate how tough it is to do by yourself. Highly recommend you reach out to Dave.</p>

<p>We have used <a href="about-us/people-and-culture/sort/united-kingdom/all/index.html">Sergio</a> and SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD to complete our ambitious project of almost doubling the size of previously 2-bedroom room house, including some changes to the old part of the house. We started with a relatively tight budget and wanted to have the job done in summer. We have been impressed as the work started rapidly and went smoothly without any of our inputs and minimal disruptions. We believe and verified independently that the structural work including foundations, brick work, roof, and timber had been done to high standard. Sergio and the team were flexible and fair in accepting and consulting any changes, and also very smart in resolving unexpected obstacles. The work completed in 3 months, unlike similar projects in the area which we have seen taking between 6-12 months. We highly recommend Sergio and his team and we think of using them again for kitchen renovation as we save some more money.</p>

<p><a href="about-us/people-and-culture/leigh-mcdonald-melbourne-renovation-specialist/index.html">Leigh</a> and the entire team at SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD were a great pleasure to deal with from the onset. Leigh understood my concerns and reservations as I was project managing the major renovation of the&#160;suite, bathroom, toilet, laundry on behalf of my 77 year old father while he was away. Having been previously in the building industry as a project manager, the ease of daily communication, design assistance, Leigh's skill level,&#160;understanding, the skill level of all trades was second to none, alleviating any concerns that I knew could potentially but did NOT arise. The entire project including additional items such as new bi-fold doors, stacker doors, additional lighting and so on has completely transformed my father's home, adding a significant increase to the value as a result. Leigh and myself often joked that I would move in and put Dad elsewhere LOL. I unreservedly recommend to anyone that they consider SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD and Leigh before making a final decision such as I did.&#160;An extremely Happy Customer.</p>

<p>We had a great experience using SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD East and South East. We converted our garage into a home office, and couldn&#8217;t be happier with the renovation. From the initial inquiry right through to completion, <a href="about-us/people-and-culture/leigh-mcdonald-melbourne-renovation-specialist/index.html">Leigh</a> provided excellent customer service - friendly, knowledgeable and very responsive. We were always kept updated and there were no surprises. The project finished on time and on budget, and we couldn&#8217;t be more pleased with the results. The design elements suggested by Leigh and Richard beautifully blend the new facade with the old, and the inside looks really special. It&#8217;s a much nicer space than we could have imagined. We chose SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD hoping for an easy, all-inclusive end-to-end process, and that&#8217;s exactly what we got. We highly recommend Leigh and his team.</p>

<p>Mark and I recently had our very dated and old bathroom renovated by SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD and have been rewarded with a brilliant modern new bathroom. This was our first renovation project ever and SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD made it easy and seamless from step one through to completion. From our consultant Janelle through to our wonderful project manager Megan, it has been a rewarding experience in what can be a very stressful time! We would especially like to thank Megan for her patience, unfailing enthusiasm and smiling face and all her help in dealing with any hiccups that came up (very few of them!) We would highly recommend SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD and happily use them in the future.  </p>

<p>Although we are ardent about doing our own renovations, this time our ages along with the complexity of a bathroom and civil engineering required for the driveway meant we needed someone to project manage the several skills required. This is new territory for us and we are quite particular about what we want done and perhaps how things should happen. <a href="about-us/people-and-culture/jim-gleeson-auckland-renovation-builder/index.html">Jim Gleeson</a> has managed consultation, design and specification with depth of technical expertise along with excellent communications. He &#8220;listens to his clients&#8221; particularly well and offers sage advice when needed. At the end of this first phase of renovation, we are confident that the project is in very capable hands with him and his team at KKG Ltd.</p>

<p>Marcus &amp; his team has recently just completed our house extension. We&#8217;re so happy with the final outcome of our new living room, laundry, bedroom &amp; Master Ensuite. Marcus helped us come up with the right plan &amp; design with the extension. We certainly couldn&#8217;t be more happier with all the work he &amp; his team has done. I highly recommend him for any house renovation or house extension works. We have been looking for a builder for our extension for a long time but most of the time we are quoted way beyond our budget. There was a time that we were looking at building a granny flat at the back of our house because it is too expensive to extend. Marcus has given us hope that it is possible to build within our budget and he did.</p>
