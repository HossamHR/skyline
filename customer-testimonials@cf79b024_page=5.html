<p>Our en suite renovation was completed this week by Paul Cree and Tas. We are absolutely thrilled with the result. Both Paul and Tas were extremely helpful with our many enquiries and all of our requests were dealt with on a professional manner. We would definitely recommend their services in fact, we are now considering renovating our kitchen.

<p>I would recommend&#160;SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD because they are good at problem-solving and look to work with the client to deliver the client&#8217;s brief. There are unexpected issues on every build and what separates good builders from bad is the way they communicate with the client when these issues occur. SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD excel at such communications so I&#8217;d be more than happy to recommend them to others.</p>

<p>We were very happy with the entire experience with <a href="about-us/people-and-culture/hashim-nasser-sydney-renovation-builder/index.html">Hashim Nasser</a> (<a href="about-us/service-areas/sydney.html">Sydney</a>). We were kept updated during most elements of the process and if there were any issues we were always informed.<br>
I particularly appreciated the patience and care that was taken with all the small adjustments we had at the end. My only negative feedback is that a couple of decisions were made on the spot without giving us the opportunity to talk through our options as much as we would like (in particular the toilet). In general a great experience and will use again.</p>

<p>We are pretty happy with the final product but it took a longer time and more negotiating than we expected. The SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD Gold Coast&#160;team&#160;were&#160;very pleasant and quick to address issues when they arose and made us feel comfortable about making changes and corrections to ensure the bathroom was right for us. No unexpected or additional costs which was great. Easy to get along with and whilst timelines were longer than promised, that seems to be pretty common in this industry. Some finishes were below what we expected but when we raised these&#160;things, they were swiftly rectified. We really like the finished product!<br>

<p>I was a little nervous about undertaking my first big renovation, but from the very start I felt very confident with the team from SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD&#160;(<a href="about-us/people-and-culture/stephen-cox-central-coast-renovation-builder.1.html">Stephen Cox</a>).&#160;  </p>

<p>I was highly impressed with the team of tradesmen - it was clear they had been hand-picked for their experience, quality of workmanship and attention to detail. The whole process was seamless from start to finish. The project was so well managed and streamlined that it honestly was so stress-free. I was also very happy with the transparency with costs, so there were no hidden surprises at the end.  </p>

<p>The finished product is the most amazing bathroom which looks truly 'refreshed'. I really can't speak highly enough of SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD and for my next renovation I wouldn't even consider going to someone else.</p>

<p>The quote was very detailed, showing exactly what was&#160;to be done and showing 3D CAD drawings of the proposed work to give me an idea of how the job would&#160;look like once completed. The communication was&#160;excellent between the builder and myself.&#160;He&#160;called me most days either asking my opinion on details or explaining any issues that had come up.&#160;He was on site when my PC orders arrived and checked each item to make sure it was there and in good condition.  </p>

<p>I can only fault the communication between the owner Stephen, the builder Greg and myself when one problem occurred with the gas line.&#160;Greg called to let me know my gas regulator was leaking, which the plumber found when pressure-checking after he installed a new line for a gas cooktop in the kitchen.&#160;I was told to call AGL and get them to come replace the regulator, which they did.&#160;Two days later I had an email from Stephen asking to be paid for the plumbers'&#160;time to find the leaking gas regulator.&#160;I believe it is the plumbers'&#160;responsibility to purge and check the line for leaks after installing a new line so couldn't understand why I was being charged for this. To keep everyone happy and the job continuing to run smoothly, <a href="about-us/people-and-culture/stephen-cox-central-coast-renovation-builder.1.html">Stephen</a> and I agreed that I pay $150 for the plumbers'&#160;time and materials. I asked Stephen to, in the&#160;future,&#160;call me and discuss any issues&#160;and any cost involved before going ahead with the work.</p>

<p>SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD have been a pleasure to deal with, especially <a href="about-us/people-and-culture/alan-gemmill-christchurch-renovation-builder.html">Alan</a> from Christchurch. This is the third undertaking we&#8217;ve had with SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD in two different properties from: full bathroom, full kitchen, all flooring, retrospective double-glazing and now landscaping renovations. He goes above and beyond in understanding the client&#8217;s perspective and tastes and will provide advice accordingly in regard to design and costs. The cost is higher than some but an exceptional project manager definitely makes a big difference; I could rest easy in knowing that progress is being made and all I have to worry about is confirming designs, choosing colours, plants etc. Communication is great and he will keep you updated on current and future progress. Though we&#8217;ve had delays in completion, this has been managed to ensure quality is up to the highest standard.

<p>I have waited 17 years to complete the renovations on my home, over these years I must have employed some of most unreliable and marginally honest trades&#8217; people that Auckland has to offer. This time I was determined that the work would be done properly and by folk I could trust.  </p>

<p>From the outset <a href="about-us/people-and-culture/jim-gleeson-auckland-renovation-builder.1.html">Jim</a> impressed me; straight-forward, honest, imaginative and thorough. After a few initial conversations Jim returned with advice and quotes. In addition, he was able to present ideas that I had not considered. The plan was exactly what I wanted and I felt comfortable to leave the country for a month safe in the knowledge that <a href="about-us/people-and-culture/jim-gleeson-auckland-renovation-builder.1.html">Jim</a> and his team were dealing with the work. Whenever there was a decision to make Jim ensured that it was within my budget and kept clear and open communication with me about the job while I was not around.  </p>

<p>I really valued the contacts and relationship that <a href="about-us/people-and-culture/jim-gleeson-auckland-renovation-builder.1.html">Jim</a> and the SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD team were able to bring to the job. Choosing kitchen units, bathroom units, tiles and the multitude of other products associated with the renovation was a very easy process.  </p>

<p>Not having to deal with sub-trades is worth its weight in gold, I could focus on my day job and not feel that I was having to do two jobs at the same time.  </p>

<p>While the roof was being replaced <a href="about-us/people-and-culture/jim-gleeson-auckland-renovation-builder.1.html">Jim</a> realized that one part of the house was not insulated &#8211; a small gift from a prior tradesman. In a gesture of real generosity <a href="about-us/people-and-culture/jim-gleeson-auckland-renovation-builder.1.html">Jim</a> did this at no charge. There were many other instances of <a href="about-us/people-and-culture/jim-gleeson-auckland-renovation-builder.1.html">Jim</a>&#8217;s thoughtfulness and kindness.  </p>

<p>I would recommend SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD and <a href="about-us/people-and-culture/jim-gleeson-auckland-renovation-builder.1.html">Jim Gleeson</a> in the highest terms possible. If you want work professionally completed with good humor and on budget then I suggest you have a conversation with <a href="about-us/people-and-culture/jim-gleeson-auckland-renovation-builder.1.html">Jim</a>.</p>

<p>We were looking to do a range of work on our property including repairs/renovations to our home, building a large garage and landscaping.  </p>

<p>We had lots of ideas and stipulations but didn't know where to begin. We didn't want to waste time/money by doing something wrong or in the wrong order and having to redo things. This was especially important as we didn't have the funds to complete the job in its entirety from the start; it would be an ongoing process.  </p>

<p>We found SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD online and was promptly put in contact with <a href="about-us/people-and-culture/wayne-and-anna-gordon.html">Wayne Gordon</a> from Palmerston North and we haven't looked back. Wayne has contacts with a host of different service people and trades people. As he has to work with them regularly, he only uses those who are reliable and do a good job. Within no time we had comprehensive plans for the entire property which gave as a direction to move forward.  </p>

<p>The job is ongoing but the work we have had done so far has be done quickly, thoroughly, and to a very high standard. Wayne has made an effort to keep in touch with us even when no work is going on, just to make sure everything is on track and keep us up to date with any eventualities. I can't say enough about his excellent service.  </p>

<p>If you're looking do do some renovations/alterations to your place and you're looking for quality and reliability at a fair price you can't go wrong with SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD.<br>

<p>We undertook a re-design and installation of a kitchen, bathroom and living room area of our property - a significant renovation for us. SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD were fantastic - the design took some time and mostly from our indecisions but they were very patient and we did not feel obliged.  </p>

<p>The build started as planned and while there were a few minor changes due to material supply we were very happy with progress, information sharing and the build quality. Wayne went out of his way to keep us informed and to address issues quickly. The end product we are very happy with. I would recommend SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD if you are thinking of hassle free renovations.<br>

<p>After years of procrastinating, I finally got around to "doing up" my original 60's kitchen. Of course, that also meant removing a wall between the kitchen and dining room, and new wooden bifold doors and windows to replace two old windows, so it was a bit more than just a do up.<br>
<a href="about-us/people-and-culture/wayne-and-anna-gordon.html">Wayne</a> from SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD was a wonderful project manager. From his initial visit through to completion everything was coordinated to fit round my work hours, and he kept in touch throughout the entire job, so there were no surprises. Once the work actually started I really appreciated his ability to coordinate the various tradespeople. I knew that I could walk out the door to go to work in the morning and not worry about a thing. Wayne would ensure that whoever was scheduled for that day had access, and that the house would be secure on my return. I still walk into the kitchen in the mornings and don't really believe it is real. Without Wayne and SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD I think I would still be cooking on my old Frigidaire stove.<br>

<p>I believe my case is a bit different to the others. Since I was remote (Hong Kong), my entire home renovation was done on the other side of the world. Paul was not only the person who helped me to manipulate the renovation work, he was also the designer for my home. When I came up with ideas, he provided his professional knowledge in details for me to judge what could be done and what could not be done. I would say, with a different language and being in another part of the world, it was a seamless work experience when I worked with Paul.  </p>

<p>Indeed Nicole (business partner with Paul) was just the correct person to keep in touch with all other renovation details to make the job even more prefect.<br><br>
&#160;<br><br>
Ultimately, I feel very comfortable and happy with the renovation; such as new kitchen, new awesome bathroom, perfect wooden floors and personalised wardrobe and colours that combine throughout made amazing artwork.<br><br>
&#160;<br><br>
Therefore, I would certainly recommend Paul and Nicole for your renovation in terms of their professional knowledge. Reasonable on price and a very responsive partner to help you through a stress free renovation task!</p>

<p>Purchased a lifestyle home on April 2013. House required maintenance, started hiring tradies and found them to be unreliable, slow, and of lower standards (before, during, and after the completion of work). We attended the Palmerston North Home Show in May 2013 and met <a href="about-us/people-and-culture/wayne-and-anna-gordon.html">Wayne Gordon</a> at the SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD stand.  </p>

<p>We explained our situation to him and he listened, came over to the house for an interview and inspection. He noted the problem and helped us with a plan to address the problem. Within a week we had a plan of the job, the cost, who is doing the work and their references.  </p>

<p>We are up to stage 4 of the maintenance work and Mr Gordon is still working for us (two continuous years now), still keeping us informed, never letting us down, and still ensuring that we are happy with the work (and we are).<br>

<p>I'd thoroughly recommend SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD. We had a fantastic experience with Kris and his team. Our project manager (also Kris) was great and kept us updated on everything. The financial updates that Barbara sent every fortnight or so were great to see how the budget was tracking. Our entire project was on time and on budget with no issues at all. The only additional costs were extras we asked for during the project. The tradies were also excellent, very respectful of the fact that we were living in the house while all the renovations were taking place. What we particularly liked was the project management aspect of the job - my husband and I both work full-time - we just didn't have the time or expertise to attempt to try and manage a renovation project like this ourselves.</p>

<p>To date we have had a excellent experience. It has taken a while to get things going due to coordinating things with EQC but once that was done things have progressed nicely. We are having a full house renovation (or just about). Adding approximately 35 sqm with an added ensuite and total kitchen remodel. Our Renovation Specialist&#160;has been great going through the full process and keeping me informed of any items which have come up, as they always do on a project of this size. We are hoping that all continues to go well so we can be back in the house by the beginning of May 2015.</p>

<p>SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD renovations undertook a fairly complicated renovation for us. It involved knocking out some walls and turning four rooms into one large open plan space and updating the kitchen. In the process we also swapped some windows and doors about and also updated the joinery in the area and added a new front door. The reason I initially spoke to SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD was because of the in-house architect as we needed to know if we could safely remove walls. Our Renovation Consultant was wonderful - she was organised and prompt, and we were always kept well informed. When I said I didn't want the space tiled our Renovation Consultant suggested timber flooring and was able to source some recycled rimu from Christchurch, which, thanks to the amazing man Richard (another contact of our Renovation Consultant's) who laid it for us, lives again as the most beautiful floor. The kitchen is lovely and the team at Kitchen Dynamics in Waiuku (whom SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD contacted to do the kitchen) were great to deal with and nothing was ever a problem. We also had a wedding on site so had a tight time frame but everything was finished on time and we really enjoyed the process of the renovation. It has given us motivation to finish the rest of the house now. We now have a beautiful space to live in and we can't thank the team at SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD enough.</p>

<p>Kris and his team did our bathroom renovation and kitchen floor tiling and they were great. Although not the biggest job we were never made to feel as though it was a "side job". Any queries we had were answered, any problems were solved. Kris went out of his way to help make the job easier - even helping on the weekend. They understood our situation of three young kids and one bathroom! All the trades used were great - they were polite, respectful and ensured the place was tidy at the end of the day. We have no hesitation in recommending Kris and the SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD team. Thanks!</p>

<p>We decided to engage SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD to do our renovations as we liked the idea that they took care of everything, and that they were experts in renovations rather than new builds. We were not disappointed. The level of organisation and communication was very good. We especially liked the BuilderTrend website they used as it contained up-to-date information on the progress, timelines, budget and schedule of works. It was also a great way to communicate with the project manager, Jade, who was also always available on his mobile for any questions. Kris MacGregor, the franchise owner, was great too. His background as a builder helped to ensure our brief was both doable and cost effective. Kris also put us on to some good suppliers who were able to suggest better products at cheaper prices.  </p>

<p>The project ran pretty much to schedule, with any delays mostly due to us adding more requirements as we went along! Paul the lead builder was awesome. He often came up with helpful suggestions, and his attention to detail was impressive. We are very happy with the finished product and are happy to recommend Kris and his team.</p>

<p>Having just bought our retirement house we have been 'future-proofing' it for when we get old. SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD co-ordinated the refurbishment of the kitchen and created a 'wet-bathroom' in 2014. <a href="about-us/people-and-culture/wayne-and-anna-gordon.html">Wayne</a>, the SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD chap, never promised anything that he couldn't deliver. He enabled the whole project to run smoothly, the various tradesmen arrived on site, and departed within the promised time scale, thus giving a sense at all times that we were moving towards our nominated finish time. Wayne even went the extra mile in suggesting and placing our 'old kitchen' on his personal TradeMe web site (I don't have one), thereby reducing our costs.<br><br>
We have been so happy with Wayne and SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD that we have them back at the moment (May 2015) undertaking the next phase of our 'refurbishing for our old age' involving external and internal painting and insulation (roof and underfloor). Again we have the careful consultation with the tradesmen arriving on the promised days. Wayne and SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD make these jobs so easy. He has a comprehensive list of competent tradesmen who are efficient, do a good job, and are economical. We heartily recommend them.<br>

<p>We used <a href="about-us/people-and-culture/wayne-and-anna-gordon.html">Wayne</a> at SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD to help us renovate our kitchen. We are about to embark on another project and didn&#8217;t think twice about calling Wayne again. He was always a pleasure to work with, personable and gave us constant feedback and updates on the project. It also appears that he has selected a group of high-quality contractors who, in their own right, were very pleasant to deal with.

<p>SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD was one of three renovation companies we met with to discuss our renovation project. They were the only company that followed up with me after the initial meeting. After a couple more meetings to discuss the scope of the project I felt comfortable I could work with <a href="about-us/people-and-culture/jim-gleeson.html">Jim Gleeson</a>, the franchise owner and entered into a contract. The renovation was not small - a completely new kitchen and bathroom, removal of an internal wall, moving a toilet, refitting the laundry, installation of bamboo flooring, painting, carpeting and general repairs were required for the entire house.  </p>

<p><a href="about-us/people-and-culture/jim-gleeson.html">Jim</a> was an extremely responsive project manager and was highly visible for the duration of the project. The trades people used were professional and for the most part very efficient. No renovation project goes entirely to plan, but <a href="about-us/people-and-culture/jim-gleeson.html">Jim</a> dealt directly with any glitches, keeping me well informed along the way. I made a number of changes as the project progressed - these were accommodated without issue. The project ran close to two weeks over the projected end date, but the team worked hard, putting in some long hours to ensure things were done by Christmas.  </p>

<p>You pay more to have a renovation company manage your renovation project. I was aware of that before we started, but it was so worth it to not have to source product, deal with contractors, spend masses of time on things we have no knowledge about or experience with. Using a renovation company may not be for everyone, but based on my experience I would definitely use SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD and in particular <a href="about-us/people-and-culture/jim-gleeson.html">Jim Gleeson</a> again - and will in fact be contacting him for phase 2 of the planned improvements of my most valuable asset.</p>

<p>We asked refresh to come and quote on a small renovation of our kitchen in our 1980s two storey house. We had no idea how SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD worked at the time so we were flying blind. After being in touch with SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD national they put us in contact with the local franchise and <a href="about-us/people-and-culture/wayne-and-anna-gordon.html">Wayne Gordon</a>. This process was fast and efficient and Wayne was so friendly and helpful. He came back quickly with all quotes and plans and the process was so easy we ended up extending our renovations to include the bathroom, toilet upstairs and downstairs flooring and laundry. Wayne stayed in contact throughout the consent and building, project managing everything. I changed more than one detail last minute and none of the changes phased Wayne or his team. Any communication issues were rectified with no fuss and we were left with exactly what we wanted. I would reccomend Wayne and refresh renovations as being a practical affordable way to build extend or renovate.<br>

<p>We found <a href="about-us/people-and-culture/wayne-and-anna-gordon.html">Wayne</a> a capable and pleasant manager, quick to deal with even the smallest issues as they arose. The builders onsite doing the renovations of bathroom and kitchen, around a family of five, were both pleasant and professional. A team member happily made several return visits to deal with the ongoing hassle of grass seed that wouldn't take after completion of the project. We continue to enjoy the renovations and will gladly use this team for any future building work.<br>

<p>We have only good comments to make about the professional and efficient manner in which our bathroom renovation was carried out. Being a small room with limited options for the layout, <a href="about-us/people-and-culture/kim-reiche.html">Kim</a> was able to come up with a plan that not only met our criteria, but looks very modern, and is also, very user friendly. <a href="about-us/people-and-culture/kim-reiche.html">Kim</a> and her team of contractors had tips along the way which helped us immensely with the issues of lighting and colours, etc. Everything went very smoothly throughout the process and we liked the fact that we were kept informed throughout the renovation as to what was happening and when. At no time did we feel left out of the loop, and <a href="about-us/people-and-culture/kim-reiche.html">Kim</a> and her team were always willing to listen to our ideas and concerns. We would highly recommend SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD to anyone and have done so recently. Happy clients.</p>

<p>Paul was not only the project manager for my renovation but also my interior designer. My home had not had any work done in over 20 years, so it required remedial work as well as renovation work. He came up with ideas I loved, I came up with some ideas he loved (he had the most ideas by far).<br><br>
&#160;<br><br>
We started with a budget. As work progressed I changed some things (and he didn&#8217;t even roll his eyes at me, at least not that I noticed), he changed some things&#8230; and the end cost was still within the original quote. I thought my changes were going to blow out the cost, so I was very surprised and happy that it did not happen.<br><br>
&#160;<br><br>
Paul&#8217;s business partner Nicole was also awesome. She helped me with curtains and a sofa. While I chose the curtains (with her encouragement), I was at first unsure of how they were going to be hung&#8230; But I love love love the end result.  </p>

<p>I&#8217;m very very happy with my new home. New fantastic kitchen, new awesome bathroom, polished wooden floors, carpet, insulation, personalised wardrobe, colours that flow throughout, amazing artwork.<br><br>
&#160;<br><br>
I would totally recommend Paul and Nicole for your renovation. I now regard them as friends, because they comforted me, encouraged me, helped me and looked after me throughout the stressful process. I couldn&#8217;t praise them high enough.</p>

<p>As a single female, I embarked on renovations in 2016. I had several objectives to achieve: fix the&#160;glass conservatory that was leaking but also very hot in the summer. As it surrounded my kitchen and partially covered it, this made working in the kitchen very hot work in the height of summer. My kitchen was also dated and although functional, there were aspects of it that could be better.  </p>

<p>As I didn&#8217;t think the process needed an architect as I was not altering the footprint of the house, I came across SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD (<a href="about-us/people-and-culture/kim-reiche-franklin-renovation-builder/index.html">Kim Reiche</a>) while searching the internet. From what I read I thought they might fit the bill of needing a company that could achieve what I wanted and project manage the process.  </p>

<p>After contacting the company online, there was a swift response to answer my request to have a meeting to discuss my ideas and what I wanted to achieve. SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD provide&#160;good up front materials to explain their process, and aim to work with a client to achieve what they want within a given budget.  </p>

<p>After signing up to the process, I then had several visits from the kitchen planner, the architectural draughts person and was always accompanied by my project person Charmaine. Her presence was reassuring and gave me the opportunity to bounce ideas back and forward as part of the planning. This was also helpful in getting the house ready for the renovation. As a nearly full time worker, she worked hard to ensure that she was available when it suited me, including coming to my workplace once, as well as visits to the kitchen planner (they use Mastercraft who are great), the lighting stores and to Harvey Norman for appliances. They even put flyers in the neighbours'&#160;mail to let them know what was&#160;happening.  </p>

<p>SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD were very accommodating to working to a start date when I would be on holiday so as to avoid&#160;the worst of the renovation process. I arrived home after 3 weeks away to find a new roof on my conservatory, skylights in and the kitchen well under way. As with older houses and in my case, one that had been leaking, this threw up a few curve balls. This was really when SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD excelled. When there was a problem, Charmaine was available to get a plumber, the builder, the tiler or the electrician there within a day to deal with the problem. To be able to leave this to someone else to deal with was such a relief.  </p>

<p>So now several weeks down the track from finishing the renovations I am really enjoying my newly renovated spaces. The conservatory is a much nicer space and already more in use as it is not the hot house it was. The temperature in the kitchen is much better and I am really enjoying cooking, which is a pleasure of mine. The lighting has&#160;improved so much &#8211; I don&#8217;t think I had realised how bad it was until now and the layout and storage space is amazing. The new appliances also mean that if I plan a dinner party I have plenty of oven space and hobs for cooking, and am not planning the menu around the cooking facilities.  </p>

<p>I had a great experience with the tradespeople SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD use- they were always very personable and kept things very tidy despite it being a worksite. Costs were very clearly detailed, and bills arrived electronically and hard copy. Receipts were also done electronically and were prompt. Did I keep to budget? The initial budget was unrealistic considering a high spec kitchen was installed and a new roof, and then there were the extra costs incurred from the surprises thrown up by the house. However the end result is very pleasing and now&#160;I have the peace of mind that the leaks are fixed. So would I recommend this company? For someone in my situation I would. It worked well for my work situation and was far less stressful than if I had had to project manage this myself.</p>

<p>Don was great right from the first meeting, he understood what I wanted to achieve, I felt totally involved in the project and I was. It was like working with an old friend, he was very easy to get on with, and came up with some great ideas to improve the process and the outcome. I found him easy to communicate with - he has excellent customer service skills, he went the extra mile and helped out with things I wouldn't have expected him to do to make sure we kept to the very tight time frames and budget and I think formost he is a naturally honest hard working guy who enjoys what he does and that shows. I would highly recommend Don and would have no hesitation in using him again on any future projects I may undertake.</p>

<p><a href="about-us/people-and-culture/alan-gemmill-christchurch-renovation-builder.html">Alan</a> and&#160; his crew have been a fantastic bunch of people to work with.&#160; I am a non-technical woman, who quite frankly did not understand any of the terminology that builders, etc use.&#160; Definitely not my thing! Alan calmly worked me through all of this.<br>
-   The first job he completed for me was the replacement of an out-of-date half window from my lounge with bi-fold doors which has allowed me to completely open the lounge into a small courtyard.&#160; &#8211; Great job &#8211; everyone remarks on the light and airiness of the room now.&#160; I have an added plus from this &#8211; because the doors were double-glazed (and I live on a busy street) I am virtually soundproof now.<br>
-   Next came removal and replacement of the front door &#8211; I now have (again double-glazed) a solid wood door with observation glass panel for security.<br>
-   The third job they did was to remove the door at the base of the stairs (through the wall from the bi-folds) and replace it with a double-glazed floor-ceiling window (opens for ventilation).&#160; Again fantastic job.<br>
Next on the list is complete renovation of my bathroom and painting of the exterior of my house. If I had not been happy with the first job &#8211; I never would have contemplated giving them the others.&#160; I find them knowledgeable, helpful, their work habits are tidy and they are as non-intrusive as they can be in a small unit. Would I recommend them? &#8211; yes, in a heartbeat.</p>

<p>Having recently returned to New Zealand and as a new resident in Hawkes Bay, I was finding the process of renovating my newly purchased 1950's house daunting. I had no knowledge of local trades people or costs, and the quotes I was being given varied so greatly that I didn't know where to start!<br><br>
&#160;<br><br>
Then I met Bev and Dennis from SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD, and all my problems melted away.&#160;&#160; They took my list of what I wanted, interviewed trades people and came back with a price. As in all renovations it was beyond my budget, so they worked with me to define what was actually needed, and how much we could do with the money I had.<br><br>
&#160;<br><br>
They coordinated and managed the documentation and council requirements, purchased fixtures and fittings, ensured the "tradies" turned up when required and that the work they did was of a high standard,&#160; kept me up to date with what was happening when I was out of town, and ensured there were no unexpected cost over runs. Their ongoing suggestions on how to maximise my limited budget and to best utilise existing spaces were much appreciated, and demonstrated their experience.<br><br>

People talk about the stress of renovating.... I can honestly say that working with Bev and Dennis took the stress away, and left me able to enjoy the adventure of seeing a wonderful home appear within the walls of a previously unloved house.</p>

<p>We found Mike and the SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD Team very easy to deal with. Everything was upfront and easy to understand. Communication was very good. They delivered on what we wanted promptly, and the work was to a very high standard. We are happy to recommend them to anyone wanting a stress-free renovation</p>

<p>After having suffered a series of botched bathroom renovations over the&#160;span of many years, I decided to employ SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD. For 14 years we hadn&#8217;t enjoyed using our two bathrooms&#160;and we had a considerable leaking problem from both showers.  </p>

<p>From the moment SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD were engaged, <a href="about-us/people-and-culture/lia-boersma-wellington-renovation-builder.1.html">Charmaine</a>, our project manager, took a quiet yet totally reliable control of the project. Together with thoroughly professional builders (Gareth and Boe), plumbers (Graham and Connor), tiliers (Andreas and Peter) and glass installer (Phil), they left us with beautiful bathrooms which we can enjoy. The tiliers were so good I got them to retile the kitchen as well!  </p>

<p>Thanks to everyone involved. You restored my faith in New Zealand&#8217;s building profession.</p>

Thank you&#160;so much&#160;for making our bathroom renovation so easy and for taking care of all the details for us, especially in seeking out all the fixtures and fittings we wanted and in managing the schedule and tradies. The whole experience was very low stress and now we have a light and modern bathroom instead of a dark outdated one &#8211; wonderful.</p>

<p>We searched the internet and found SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD, I&#8217;m very glad we did. It would have been very hard to organise it all ourselves.

<p>To whom it may concern,  </p>

<p>We have been impressed with the professional and polished approach taken by the team at Traffic in their establishment and roll-out of the SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD Renovation franchise operation.  </p>

<p>Traffic&#8217;s approach, and SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD&#8217;s processes and systems appear to be second to none.&#160; They are certainly far more advanced than a number of other franchise systems that we have had contact with.&#160; Our view is that the team at Traffic and SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD are proactive, innovative, well-organised, smart, professional and committed to excellence.  </p>

<p>As their lawyers, we have seen first hand how satisfied potential SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD franchisees are in terms of the process of introduction to the system and subsequent conversion to franchisees.<br><br>
The roll-out of the SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD franchise operation has been able to be brought to market extremely quickly without any compromise in quality &#8211; SKYLINE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS LTD had their first four franchisees signed up within four months of opening their doors to franchising.  </p>

<p>Opportunities will certainly come knocking to this franchised business, and we would recommend them, and Traffic, without hesitation.  </p>

<p>Yours faithfully  </p>
